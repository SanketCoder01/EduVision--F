# EduVision Security & Real-time Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive security and real-time data implementation for the EduVision platform, ensuring department-based isolation and mandatory registration completion.

## 🔐 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Registration Completion Requirement
**All users MUST complete registration before accessing any dashboard features.**

#### Faculty Registration:
- **Mandatory Fields:**
  - Full Name
  - Department (CSE, CY, AIDS, AIML)
  - Designation (Professor, Associate Professor, etc.)
  - Phone Number (optional)

#### Student Registration:
- **Mandatory Fields:**
  - University PRN
  - Personal Details (Name, DOB, Gender, Nationality)
  - Identity (Mobile Number, Aadhar Number)
  - Contact Details (Permanent & Current Address)
  - Family Details (Father's Name)
  - Emergency Contact

**Until registration is completed:**
- ❌ Dashboard shows only registration banner
- ❌ No assignments, announcements, or any module data visible
- ❌ All sidebar items are locked
- ✅ Only "Complete Registration" page is accessible

### 2. Department-Based Security Hierarchy

```
Cyber Security (CY) Faculty → Can access: CSE, AIDS, AIML, CY
CSE Faculty               → Can access: CSE only
AIDS Faculty              → Can access: AIDS only
AIML Faculty              → Can access: AIML only
```

#### Access Rules:
- **Faculty:**
  - Can only create content for departments they have access to
  - Can view content from accessible departments
  - Cannot modify other faculty's content
  - Registration must be completed to post anything

- **Students:**
  - Can only view content for their exact department and year
  - Must complete registration to see any content
  - Isolated from other departments completely
  - See only assignments/announcements targeted to their year

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

All tables have RLS enabled with the following policies:

#### Assignments:
```sql
-- Faculty create for accessible departments only
-- Students view only if:
  1. registration_completed = TRUE
  2. department matches
  3. year is in target_years array
```

#### Announcements:
```sql
-- Faculty create for their department
-- Students view only if:
  1. registration_completed = TRUE
  2. department matches
  3. year is in target_years array (or null for all years)
```

#### Study Materials:
```sql
-- Faculty upload for their department
-- Students download only if:
  1. registration_completed = TRUE
  2. department AND year match exactly
```

#### Timetable:
```sql
-- Faculty create for their department
-- Students view only if:
  1. registration_completed = TRUE
  2. department AND year match exactly
```

#### Quiz:
```sql
-- Faculty create for accessible departments
-- Students attempt only if:
  1. registration_completed = TRUE
  2. department AND year match
  3. quiz is published
```

#### Attendance:
```sql
-- Faculty mark for accessible departments
-- Students view/mark only if:
  1. registration_completed = TRUE
  2. department AND year match
```

#### Study Groups:
```sql
-- Students create for their own dept/year
-- Can only view groups in same dept/year
-- Must have registration_completed = TRUE
```

## 📡 Real-time Features

### Implemented Real-time Subscriptions:
1. **Assignments** - Instant updates when faculty posts new assignments
2. **Announcements** - Live notifications for new announcements
3. **Events** - Real-time event updates
4. **Study Materials** - Immediate access to new materials
5. **Timetable** - Live timetable changes
6. **Quiz** - Real-time quiz publishing
7. **Attendance** - Live attendance session updates
8. **Study Groups** - Instant group updates

### How Real-time Works:

```typescript
// Student subscribes to their department data
SupabaseRealtimeService.subscribeToStudentAssignments(student, (payload) => {
  // Automatically refreshes when faculty posts new assignment
  loadDashboardData()
})

// Faculty subscribes to their content
SupabaseRealtimeService.subscribeToTable('assignments', () => {
  // Refreshes when assignment submission received
  loadRealTimeData()
})
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### Migration File: `200_complete_department_security_realtime.sql`

**Key Changes:**
1. Added `registration_completed` boolean to faculty and students tables
2. Added `registration_step` integer to students table
3. Created `can_faculty_access_department()` function for hierarchy checks
4. Implemented comprehensive RLS policies for all modules
5. Enabled real-time publication for all tables
6. Added performance indexes

### Department Hierarchy Function:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION can_faculty_access_department(
    faculty_dept TEXT,
    target_dept TEXT
) RETURNS BOOLEAN
```

This function enforces:
- CY faculty → CSE, AIDS, AIML, CY access
- CSE faculty → CSE only
- AIDS faculty → AIDS only  
- AIML faculty → AIML only

- ✅ All data is filtered by registration_completed status
- ✅ Cross-department access properly controlled
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions respect RLS policies

## 📊 Database Performance

**Indexes Created for Optimal Performance:**
```sql
idx_students_registration_dept_year    -- Fast student filtering
idx_faculty_registration_dept          -- Fast faculty filtering
idx_assignments_dept_year_status       -- Fast assignment queries
idx_announcements_dept                 -- Fast announcement queries
idx_events_dept                        -- Fast event queries
idx_study_materials_dept_year          -- Fast material queries
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **No Static Data:** All data comes from Supabase, no localStorage
2. **Mandatory Registration:** Enforced at layout level, cannot be bypassed
3. **Department Immutability:** Once set, department cannot be changed (require admin)
4. **Real-time Everything:** All modules use real-time subscriptions
5. **Security First:** RLS policies checked on every database query

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```
