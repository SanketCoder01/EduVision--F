## üìù Database Setup Instructions

### 1. Run the Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
# supabase/migrations/300_comprehensive_real_data_system.sql
```

### 2. Verify Tables and Functions
```sql
-- Check if functions exist
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name LIKE '%student%';

-- Check if notification_log table exists
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'notification_log';
```

### 3. Enable Realtime
In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Replication:
- Enable realtime for: `students`, `faculty`, `notification_log`

## üîÑ Real-time Flow Example

### Faculty Posts Assignment:
1. Faculty creates assignment with department="cse" and target_years=["third"]
2. Database trigger automatically creates notifications for all CSE 3rd year students
3. Students subscribed to notifications receive instant toast notification
4. Today's Hub updates with new assignment
5. Badge count increments

### Student Completes Registration:
1. Student fills out complete-profile form
2. API saves to `students` table with `registration_completed=true`
3. Student data becomes available to faculty in same department
4. Student can now access all modules and receive notifications

- ‚úÖ Faculty can manage real students
- ‚úÖ Registration completion tracking works
- ‚úÖ No static/mock data remaining
- ‚úÖ Database queries optimized with indexes
- ‚úÖ RLS policies secure all data access

## üîó Integration Priority Order

1. **Attendance** (Most frequently used)
2. **Assignments** (Core academic feature)
3. **Today's Hub** (Central notification hub)
4. **Study Groups** (Collaborative learning)
5. **Announcements** (Communication)
6. **Events** (Engagement)
7. **Quiz/Compiler** (Assessment)
8. **Statistics Dashboard** (Monitoring)

## üí° Best Practices

1. Always use `getStudentsByDepartmentAndYear()` instead of hardcoded lists
2. Create notifications after posting any content
3. Subscribe to real-time updates in all student-facing pages
4. Use StudentSelector component for student selection
5. Check `registration_completed` flag before showing users
6. Use department security functions for access control
7. Test with multiple departments and years
8. Verify real-time subscriptions are cleaned up on unmount
