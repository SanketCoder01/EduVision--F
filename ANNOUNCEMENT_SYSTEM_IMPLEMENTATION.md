# ✅ Real-Time Announcement System - Implementation Complete

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### ✅ **API Endpoint Created**
**File:** `app/api/announcements/create/route.ts`

- POST endpoint that saves announcements to Supabase
- Automatically creates notifications for targeted students
- Supports three targeting types:
  - **Specific Classes**: Department + specific years (e.g., CSE 3rd + 4th year)
  - **Department-Wide**: All years in a department (e.g., all CSE students)
  - **University-Wide**: All students across all departments

### ✅ **Faculty Announcement Creation** (Updated)
**File:** `app/dashboard/announcements/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Added Supabase integration
2. ✅ Fetches faculty info from database on mount
3. ✅ Real announcements fetched and displayed
4. ✅ Updated department selection (CSE, AIDS, AIML, Cyber)
5. ✅ Updated year selection (first, second, third, fourth)
6. ✅ Multi-year selection for specific classes
7. ✅ Loading state during submission
8. ✅ Real-time refresh after creation
9. ✅ Automatic notification creation

**New Features:**
- **Department + Years**: Faculty can select CSE and then choose 3rd + 4th year
- **Department All Years**: Faculty can select entire department
- **University-Wide**: Notify all students
- **Loading Indicators**: Spinner shows during submission
- **Success Messages**: Confirmation that students were notified
- **Real-time Updates**: Manage tab shows real announcements from database

### ✅ **Student Announcement View** (Updated)
**File:** `app/student-dashboard/announcements/page.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Replaced mock data with Supabase queries
2. ✅ Filters announcements by student's department and year
3. ✅ Shows university-wide announcements
4. ✅ Shows department-wide announcements
5. ✅ Shows year-specific announcements
6. ✅ Real-time subscription for instant updates
7. ✅ Auto-refresh when faculty posts new announcement

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// Students see announcements if:
1. University-wide (department = null)
2. Department-wide (department matches, target_years is empty)
3. Class-specific (department matches AND year in target_years)
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Flow 1: Faculty Posts Class-Specific Announcement

```
1. Faculty selects "Specific Classes"
2. Chooses Department: CSE
3. Selects Years: 3rd, 4th
4. Fills announcement details
5. Clicks "Create Announcement"
   ↓
6. API saves to announcements table:
   {
     department: "cse",
     target_years: ["third", "fourth"],
     ...
   }
   ↓
7. Notification service creates notifications:
   - Queries all CSE 3rd year students
   - Queries all CSE 4th year students
   - Inserts notifications for each student
   ↓
8. Real-time broadcast via Supabase
   ↓
9. Students' browsers receive update instantly
10. Announcement appears in Today's Hub & Announcements page
```

### Flow 2: Faculty Posts Department-Wide Announcement

```
1. Faculty selects "Department Years"
2. Chooses Department: AIDS
3. Clicks "Create Announcement"
   ↓
4. API saves:
   {
     department: "aids",
     target_years: [],  // Empty = all years
     ...
   }
   ↓
5. Notification service:
   - Queries ALL AIDS students (all years)
   - Creates notifications for each
   ↓
6. All AIDS students receive notification
```

### Flow 3: Faculty Posts University-Wide Announcement

```
1. Faculty selects "All University"
2. Confirms selection
3. Clicks "Create Announcement"
   ↓
4. API saves:
   {
     department: null,  // null = all departments
     target_years: [],
     ...
   }
   ↓
5. Notification service loops through departments:
   - Creates notifications for CSE students
   - Creates notifications for AIDS students
   - Creates notifications for AIML students
   - Creates notifications for Cyber students
   ↓
6. ALL students across university receive notification
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE announcements (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(100),  -- null = university-wide
    target_years TEXT[],       -- [] = all years, ['third'] = specific
    faculty_id UUID REFERENCES faculty(id),
    priority VARCHAR(20),
    target_audience VARCHAR(20),
    date TIMESTAMP,
    time VARCHAR(10),
    venue VARCHAR(255),
    poster_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Notification Query Logic
```typescript
// Student sees announcement if:
.or(`
  department.is.null,  // University-wide
  and(
    department.eq.${student.department},  // Their department
    or(
      target_years.eq.{},  // All years
      target_years.cs.{${student.year}}  // Their year included
    )
  )
`)
```

### Real-time Subscription
```typescript
// Student page subscribes to changes
const channel = supabase
  .channel('announcements_changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'announcements'
  }, () => {
    fetchAnnouncements()  // Re-fetch on any change
  })
  .subscribe()
```
